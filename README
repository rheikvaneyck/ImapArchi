imaparchi

..is a ruby program for archive emails from a imap server. Development is in progress, 
plan is to archive emails and make them searchable:

- Download IMAP emails into a local database
- separate attachments from messages
- categorise emails
- tag important emails for later progress
- analyse email usage

Current idea is to use sqlite3 as the database to store all the data in. The 
Google-chart-API is utilized to visualize the analyse data. Security protocols
shall be used for authentication and transmitting emails.

Enjoy watching the progress or despair of it.
